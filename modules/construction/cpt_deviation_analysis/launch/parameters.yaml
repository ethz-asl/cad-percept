# Segmentation
planarSegmentation: CGAL # CGAL or PCL

segmentationDistanceThreshold: 0.03 # distance to model, at least around the precision of the LiDAR
segmentationNormalThreshold: 0.1 # normal tolerance in rad

# Association
minPolyhedronArea: 0.5 # minimum area of facet

matchAngleThresh: 0.5 # max angle between pc and facet [rad]
